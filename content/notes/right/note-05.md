**Archivum temporis**

Git commits are our modern scriptoriumsâ€”each one a careful preservation of thought at a moment in time. The commit message becomes the marginalia, explaining not just what changed but why.

Future archaeologists will excavate our repositories as we now study medieval codices, seeking to understand how we thought and worked.
